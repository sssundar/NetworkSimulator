FAST: Is not drop-based, only update by RTT. Update on fixed period, but can average over packet window.
Links: if current direction oldest is older than other buffer, send, even if can't get there in time i.e. destroy links.
Plotting
	Plot everything
	Be smart about averages
	Single bash script to run & usage 
	Report: concise, plots, theoretical results from HW, brief architecture, brief assumptions
	Presentation: lots of graphs to demonstrate it works. test cases. 

RENO: Keep track of RTT, varying timeout as 3x max RTT
RENO has bugs - test case 1 fr/ft/ timeout / ss triplekack & immediate TO?
