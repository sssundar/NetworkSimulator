		FAST: Fix this timeout via 3xRTT bug
		VEGAS: Fix this timeout via 3xRTT bug

		Plotting
			Plot everything
			Be smart about averages
			Single bash script to run & usage
				separate input file for test case selection and tcp 		
		Links: if current direction oldest is older than other buffer, send, even if can't get there in time i.e. destroy links.		

	Presentation: lots of graphs to demonstrate it works. test cases. 
	Report: concise, plots, theoretical results from HW, brief architecture, brief assumptions
