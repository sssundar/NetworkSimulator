Packet Delay Calculations

Debugging/Questions for Ritvik
------------------------------
Have # timeouts count, have measurements.txt showing tons of triple acks, and ft/fr
Have strange graphs showing very poor congestion control (not stabilizing).
num_packets_outstanding is very strange.

At some point, add logging for static flows - window size starts at?

If receive packet acknowleding 9, then should ack 8 & set ack_time, remove in transit,
decrement outstanding packets if 8 is still outstanding. Might lose 8's ack,
and then outstanding_packets would keep increasing slowly.

Should we also increasing W to match # packets effectively ack'd, rather than # acks received?

Curerntly, logging for time-windowing on packet delay will see a bunch of 
numbers at the same time and take the last one. This seems wrong.
