Packet Delay Calculations

Debugging/Questions for Ritvik
------------------------------
Have # timeouts count, have measurements.txt showing tons of triple acks, and ft/fr
Have strange graphs showing very poor congestion control (not stabilizing).
num_packets_outstanding is very strange.

At some point, add logging for static flows - window size starts at?

If receive packet acknowleding 9, then should ack 8 & set ack_time, remove in transit,
decrement outstanding packets if 8 is still outstanding. Might lose 8's ack,
and then outstanding_packets would keep increasing slowly.


Right now, we are duplicating outstanding-- (In receive and timeout)
We are timing out because the time is too little and not because the link buffer is getting overflowed.

Packet timeout should be a function.


Should we also increasing W to match # packets effectively ack'd, rather than # acks received?
- Done for fr/ft
- Not happening for ss, ca

Curerntly, logging for time-windowing on packet delay will see a bunch of 
numbers at the same time and take the last one. This seems wrong.

Ritvik says fr.ft just divide by two
Can;t  send fr/ft immedaitely, need window size ok
Can assume all after any packet loss detection are lost lost and resend from current packet (Frft?)
In terminal.glue after 2nd slowstart/TO noticing 2-3 repeated triple acks. how?
