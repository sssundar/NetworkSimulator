Description: Pseudocode Excluding Main Loop
Target: Test Case 0
Project: NetworkSimulator
Class: CS143, Caltech, Fall 2015
Team: Ahmed, Sith, Sushant

Revision History 
	15 & 17 October 2015; Ahmed, Sith, Sushant 
		designed for test case 0 at a high level
	17 October 2015; Sushant 
		spec/pseudocode for	logging, sim, events, queues for test 0 
		most of pseudocode for links for test 0
	21 October 2015; Sith
		wrote event, linkqueue, reporter using spec
	23 October 2015; Sushant
		finished spec for links for test 0		
		finished Packet spec/pseudocode
		started Node, Host
	23 October 2015; Ahmed
		finished majority of milestone 1 presentation
		revised link_queue to use c++queue
	23 October 2015; Sith
		created network parser
		created main loop
		revised to c++ priority queue for event simulator

######################	
## To Do for Test 0 ##
######################
Spec	
	class Node extends Reporter
	class Host extends Node	
	class Flow extends Reporter
	class Source extends Flow
	class Sink extends Flow
	Main Loop

Implement in C++: Code & Commenting
Testing & Visualization Scripts off Logs
Documentation & Presentation for Phase 1 Report
	Add detail in roadmap
		specific deliverables, specific dates
	Add detail in approach
		class Router extends Node (not implemented for now)
		class RoutingSource extends Flow (not implemented for now)
		class RoutingSink extends Flow (not implemented for now )
		link delay-based switching, link delay telepathy
		link contains buffers, equal size on each end of listed capacity
		link has tx events 
		flow has packet timeout events
		multiple flows (routing source, routing sink, 
						 data source, data sink)
		if a packet times out, the flow should still be able to accept
			later acks for that packet (possibly in transit during timeout)
			gracefully
		flow telepathy - during parsing flows - both source/sink know max size
		delay/congestion estimates for links based on ?? telepathy?
			why wouldn't this loop like in hw2?
			ritvik said in practice, implement static routes with oversight.
			look/type out notes from last meeting
		timeouts/callback structure for events
		c++ priority queue for event-based simulation
