Description: Pseudocode Excluding Main Loop
Target: Test Case 0
Project: NetworkSimulator
Class: CS143, Caltech, Fall 2015
Team: Ahmed, Sith, Sushant

Revision History 
	15 & 17 October 2015; Ahmed, Sith, Sushant 
		designed for test case 0 at a high level
	17 October 2015; Sushant 
		spec/pseudocode for	logging, sim, events, queues for test 0 
		most of pseudocode for links for test 0
	23 October 2015; Sushant, Sith, Ahmed
		finished spec for links for test 0
		decided on c++ priority queue for event simulator
		started Packet spec/pseudocode

######################
## To Do for Test 0 ##
######################
Spec
	class Packet (see packet methods required in classes above)
	class Node extends Reporter
	class Host extends Node
	class Flow extends Node
	class Source extends Flow
	class Sink extends Flow
	Main Loop
Implement in C++: Code & Commenting
Testing & Visualization Scripts off Logs
Documentation & Presentation for Phase 1 Report
	Add detail in roadmap
		specific deliverables, specific dates
	Add detail in approach
		link delay-based switching, link delay telepathy
		link contains buffers, equal size on each end of listed capacity
		link has tx events 
		flow has packet timeout events
		multiple flows (routing source, routing sink, 
						 data source, data sink)
		delay/congestion estimates for links based on ?? telepathy?
			why wouldn't this loop like in hw2?
			ritvik said in practice, implement static routes with oversight.
			look/type out notes from last meeting
		timeouts/callback structure for events
		c++ priority queue for event-based simulation
