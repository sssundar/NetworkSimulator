Description: Pseudocode Excluding Main Loop
Target: Test Case 0
Project: NetworkSimulator
Class: CS143, Caltech, Fall 2015
Team: Ahmed, Sith, Sushant

Revision History 
	15 & 17 October 2015; Ahmed, Sith, Sushant 
		designed for test case 0 at a high level
	17 October 2015; Sushant 
		spec/pseudocode for	logging, sim, events, queues for test 0 
		most of pseudocode for links for test 0
	21 October 2015; Sith
		wrote event, linkqueue, reporter using spec
	23 October 2015; Sushant
		finished spec for links for test 0		
		finished Packet spec/pseudocode
		finished Node, Host
		revised links, host for easier parsing/initialization
		revised link_queue to allow variable length packets
	23 October 2015; Ahmed
		finished majority of milestone 1 presentation		
	23 October 2015; Sith
		created network parser
		created main loop
		revised to c++ priority queue for event simulator

Implement in C++: Code & Commenting
Testing & Visualization Scripts off Logs

add notes from last meeting (10-29) here
ritvik said in practice, implement static routes with oversight.
	look/type out notes from last meeting
flow control on source ok, but sink? how measure ack delays? buffer 
	size in links?
delay/congestion estimates for links based on ?? telepathy?
	why wouldn't this loop like in hw2?
