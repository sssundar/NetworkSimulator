###### A team effort by Sith Domrongkitchaiporn, Ahmed Alshaia, and Sushant Sundaresh to bring experimentation & exploration to our study of networking. Our goal is to write a network simulator in C++ that takes as input an abstract description of a communications network (including not only structure but also events like node failure). We want our simulator to help us visualize the dynamical consequences of TCP congestion avoidance protocols like TCP-Reno and FAST-TCP.
